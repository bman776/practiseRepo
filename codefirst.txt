first
Here is a change to the file (2019-05-07)
Here is another freaky deaky change to the file (same date as above but like 15 minutes later)
These two changes are meant to illustratre how a file can be both modified and staged at the same time 
(but not really, read the tutorial to find out why)

Now im going to exit this file again but not stage it (didnt execute the $ git add codefirst.txt command) (same date as above but like a few hours later)

Once more I shall edit this file but not stage it so that i can use $ git diff to see what is staged and unstaged in this file

I like big boobies
